Indoor gardening is a great way to grow your own fruits, vegetables, and herbs in the comfort of your own home. To help you get the most out of your indoor garden, we’ve put together a list of tips and tricks that are sure to help you succeed.

1. **Find a Right Place For Your Indoor Garden:** Look for a well-lit area in your home that receives at least 6-8 hours of sunlight per day. South-facing windows are usually the best option, but east or west-facing windows can also work. Alternatively, you can use grow lights to supplement natural light. Read detailed guide about [selecting right place for indoor garden](https://urbangardener.wiki/posts/planning-indoor-garden/).
2. **Optimize Light Sources:** Indoor plants naturally grow towards a light source, whether it’s a window or an artificial grow light. Keep all plants equidistant from light sources to promote vertical growth. If your plants start to bend, rotate them to compensate.
3. **Provide Adequate Light:** Plants need a minimum of five hours of sunlight per day, and some require double that to bear fruit. That's why [choosing a right place for your indoor plants](https://urbangardener.wiki/posts/where-to-grow-indoor-herbs--edibles) is crucial. Make sure your plants receive enough light from a window or an artificial grow light.[](https://urbangardener.wiki/posts/where-to-grow-indoor-herbs--edibles/)
4. **Proper Watering:** More plants die from improper watering than any other problem. Follow watering guidelines to ensure your plants get the right amount of water. In hydroponic and aquaponic systems, watering is automatic, but in container gardens, it’s crucial to pay attention to watering needs.
5. **Clean Your Plants:** Wipe down leaves regularly to prevent dust and debris from accumulating, leading to healthier, more robust plants.
6. **Airflow is Essential:** Adequate airflow is crucial for your plants to thrive. Use a small fan to move air over and through your garden if natural airflow is lacking.
7. **Maintain Optimal Temperature:** Maintain a temperature around 70°F (21°C) during the day and approximately 10°F colder at night (Equivalent of ≈ 15°C). This mimics outdoor garden conditions and promotes healthy plant growth. 
8. **Keep Records:** Keep track of what you’ve planted, when you planted it, and what type of fertilizer was used. Monitor which plants do best together. Over time, you’ll notice trends that can help you maximize future production.
9. **Provide Enough Nutrients:** Every time you water your plants in container gardens, some nutrients are flushed out of the soil. Add small amounts of liquid fertilizer or more compost to maintain the required nutrient levels.
10. **Use the Right Soil:** Avoid using soil directly from outside, as it can introduce weeds and bacteria to your indoor growing medium. Use purpose-built potting soil or organic compost for best results.
11. **Ensure Proper Drainage:** Ensure your containers have proper drainage to avoid root rot and other problems associated with poor drainage.
12. **Identify and Fix Issues:** Many gardeners encounter common issues when [growing herbs indoors](https://urbangardener.wiki/posts/how-to-grow-herbs-indoors/), but there are solutions to help you overcome them.
