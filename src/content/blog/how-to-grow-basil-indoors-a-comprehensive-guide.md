## Starting Basil Indoors

Basil can be grown from seed in a variety of soil types, including loam, potting soil, or a soil mix. Seeds should be started at a depth of Ih inch and germinate in five to seven days. Basil grows 18 to 24 inches tall and should be placed in a pot that is at least 6 inches in diameter. Purple varieties, such as "Dark Opal", are beautiful and flavorful, making them a great choice for your [indoor herb garden](https://urbangardener.wiki/posts/how-to-grow-herbs-indoors/).

### Growing Basil from Cuttings:

Another way to start growing basil indoors is by taking cuttings. Select a healthy basil plant and take a 4- to 6-inch cutting from the stem. Strip off the lower leaves and place the cutting in a glass of water. Make sure to change the water every other day to prevent bacteria growth. After a week, roots should start to grow from the cutting. Once the roots are 1 to 2 inches long, you can transfer the cutting to a pot filled with potting soil or a soil mix. Make sure to keep the soil moist and the plant in a sunny location.

### Growing Basil from Transplantation:

If you prefer not to grow basil from seeds, you can also start with a small plant that has already been started. You can usually find basil plants at your local nursery or garden center. When choosing a plant, look for one that has a strong stem and healthy leaves.

To transplant the basil, gently remove it from its current container and loosen the roots. Then, plant it in a larger container filled with potting soil or a soil mix. Keep the soil moist and place the container in a sunny location with at least six hours of direct sunlight per day.

Make sure to also pinch back the main stem of the transplanted basil plant to encourage bushier growth and a fuller plant. With proper care and attention, your transplanted basil plant will grow and thrive indoors.

## Lighting Requirements for Growing Basil Indoors

Basil is a sun-loving herb that requires plenty of light to grow indoors. When [choosing a location for your plant](https://urbangardener.wiki/posts/planning-indoor-garden/), make sure it receives at least 6 hours of sunlight each day. If you don't have a sunny windowsill, you can supplement natural light with artificial grow lights.

For optimal growth, you should use a grow light that emits full-spectrum light, as this mimics the natural light that plants receive outdoors. LED grow lights are a popular choice for indoor gardeners because they are energy-efficient, long-lasting, and emit very little heat.

### When selecting a grow light for your basil plant, look for one with the following specifications:

**Wattage:** A 20-40 watt LED grow light is sufficient for growing one or two basil plants.

**Color temperature:** Choose a grow light with a color temperature between 5000K and 6500K, which simulates natural daylight.

**Light duration:** Basil plants require 12-16 hours of light per day to grow properly. You can set your grow light on a timer to ensure your plant receives the right amount of light each day.

Here are a few recommended grow lights for growing basil indoors:

* Spider Farmer SF-1000 LED Grow Light: This full-spectrum grow light is ideal for small indoor gardens and provides excellent coverage for one or two basil plants.
* Viparspectra P1000 LED Grow Light: This high-performance grow light is perfect for larger indoor gardens and can support up to four basil plants.
* Barrina LED Grow Light: This affordable option is great for beginners and provides full-spectrum light for up to two basil plants.

## Pinching and Pruning

Basil can quickly become thin and leggy if left unattended. However, by pinching back the main stalks early in the growing process, you can produce a thick crop of succulent foliage that makes for a beautiful pot plant. Pinch the plant back to the second set of leaves from the top to encourage bushy growth.

## Temperature and Watering

Basil thrives at average room temperature but is easily damaged by frost, so be sure not to place it outside too early or late in the year. Watering should be done infrequently, not more than once a week. Allow the soil to become moderately dry, then give the plants' roots a good soaking.

## Harvesting

About 40 days after planting, you can cut a few of the scented leaves for use in the kitchen. After 90 days, the plant will produce purple flower buds that should be pinched off before they have a chance to open. The rest of the plant should then be harvested by cutting the main stem 6 to 8 inches above the soil. If the base of the plant is left undisturbed and provided with adequate light, food, and water, it will send up new branches and leaves, providing subsequent cuttings for use in the kitchen.

## Uses for Basil

Basil leaves are versatile and can be used fresh or dried to add flavor to a variety of dishes, including those containing eggs, cheese, rice, and spaghetti sauces. In Italy, a few basil leaves are added to every jar of canned tomatoes, as the fine flavor of basil is considered essential to tomato-based dishes. Adding basil leaves to the water in which shellfish is cooked imparts a slightly spicy flavor that most seafood lovers find delicious.
