Looking for a simple and inexpensive weekend project? Consider creating a vertical garden at home! With just a few dollars in materials and some time, you can easily construct a stunning garden tower using PVC piping as the basis. This guide will walk you through the process and provide all the necessary tools and materials to get started.

Materials required for this project include:

* 4 to 6 foot section of 4 inch (10 cm) PVC pipe
* 4 to 6 foot section of ¾ inch (2 cm) PVC pipe
* Potting soil (preferably soil crystals or moisture control soil that will make watering easier)
* Seedlings
* Hole saw
* Drill bits of appropriate size
* Electric drill
* A way to stand the tower up securely

Once you have gathered all the necessary materials, it’s time to begin building your vertical garden. Each tower should only take approximately one hour to assemble, so you can easily build multiple towers in a single day.

The first step is deciding how tall you want your tower to be. Aim for something between 4 and 6 feet tall, as this will provide maximum growing room without making care and harvesting difficult.

Take the PVC pipe that you have cut to the desired length based on the mounting method you have chosen and your ideal height for watering and harvesting. Now it’s time to cut holes in the pipe where your plants will ultimately grow. To ensure that each plant has enough room to grow, consider staggering the holes in a spiral fashion working from the bottom to the top.

Each hole should be approximately 2” (5 cm) in diameter and can be easily cut using a hole saw. These holes can be made larger if the plants you are growing require it but typically 2 inches is enough for most plants to thrive.

When placing your holes, take into account the types of plants you are growing. Plants like strawberries tend to grow down, and the spaces between holes should account for this downward growth so as not to thwart the growth of plants on the lower levels of the tower.

If you will be hanging your vertical garden, drill a small hole at the bottom of the pipe to allow for drainage. Don’t forget to place a catch pan under the hole to collect the drainage.

Once you have cut out all the holes, use a fine grit sandpaper to smooth the opening of each hole. Not only could sharp edges injure you while you’re working with your plants but the edges could also damage root systems and the plants themselves as they begin to grow larger.

Now, take the smaller piece of PVC pipe and construct your nutrient distribution “pipeline”. Installing the smaller pipe in the middle ensures that each plant receives nutrients and moisture regardless of where it is positioned in the tower. Use a small drill bit to drill holes in the small PVC pipe, ensuring there are enough holes to distribute water evenly throughout the system. This small pipe can be filled with compost or you can even just use sand to distribute water evenly throughout the system and fertilize in a more conventional way.

With the tower filled with soil, it’s time to add your seedlings to the system. Use your finger to poke a hole in each of your pre-drilled locations and gently place each seedling into the hole in the potting soil.

If you will be planting strawberries, cucumbers, or any other plant that tends to grow downward, try to position these at the bottom with smaller plants or ones that tend to grow upward at the top. This ensures that one species of plant does not inhibit the growth of another.

As you place each seedling into your new garden, add a little bit of compost to the hole as well. This will help the little plant get some immediate nutrients until compost nutrients begin to trickle their way
