Regardless of the size of your home, you can cultivate a variety of edible plants indoors as long as there is some access to natural light. You can create growing zones in areas such as windowsills, under a skylight, or in well-lit rooms. If you have a dark area, you can still grow edibles by installing grow lights.

## Table of contents

## Bright, sunlit zones:

Check your home through the day to locate the brightest, sunniest spots; rooms that receive direct sun for six or more hours a day in summer are best for crops that need good light. These include most fruit plants and herbs, and fruiting vegetable crops such as [tomatoes](https://urbangardener.wiki/posts/growing-tomatoes-in-pots-from-seed-to-harvest/), eggplants, and peppers.

1. **South-facing windows:** Most indoor crops that produce fruit, edible flowers, and herbs will thrive by a south-facing window (it may be too hot and bright for lettuces and other salad crops). These areas receive light for most of the day in summer when the plants need sun for healthy leaves or to ripen their fruits.

   Suitable plants:

   * Herbs (most)
   * Edible flowers (summer blooms)
   * Fruiting vegetables
   * Fruits (except Alpine strawberries)
2. **East- and west-facing windows:** These zones wonâ€™t receive sun all day, but they offer many hours of bright light in spring and summer during the peak growing period. This may be sufficient for fruits to ripen. Keep your curtains or blinds open to maximize their exposure to the sun.

   Suitable plants:

   * Herbs (most)
   * Edible flowers
   * Sprouts, leaves, & roots
   * Fruiting vegetables
   * Fruits
3. **Beneath a skylight:** Skylights promote good growth throughout the day as they provide even top light. This zone is perfect for sun-loving crops such as fruits and fruiting vegetables. But if the room is too hot, leafy vegetables will suffer.

   Suitable plants:

   * Herbs
   * Edible flowers
   * Sprouts, leaves, & roots (if the room is not too hot)
   * Fruiting vegetables
   * Fruits (except Alpine strawberries)

## Partially sunlit zones

These areas receive sun for part of the day or even dark corners that barely see any light. You can use mirrors to illuminate gloomy areas and introduce grow lights that imitate the sun, or simply choose crops that thrive in partial shade.

1. **Walls:** The crops you choose for a wall unit or shelf depend on which direction your wall faces and how close it is to natural light. A south-facing wall can get bright sunshine while a wall facing east or west that receives just a few hours of sunlight a day and a north-facing wall offer less scope for crops.

   Suitable plants:

   * Shade-tolerant herbs (e.g., mint, parsley)
   * Sprouts
   * Lettuce
   * Small root crops, such as radishes
   * Alpine strawberries
2. **Dark corners:** Only mushrooms will grow successfully in gloomy areas that receive little or no direct sunlight, but if you introduce a grow light or two, your choices will be much greater. Most grow lights are suitable for small plants, so choose compact crops such as herbs, lettuce, and bush tomatoes.

   Suitable plants:

   * Herbs and edible flowers
   * Microgreens
   * Mushrooms (no need for grow lights)
   * Lettuce
   * Bush tomatoes
   * Chile peppers
   * Sweet peppers
3. **Center of a room:** Lettuce, sprouts, and root crops will cope well in the center of a room with a large window that faces east or west and receives some sunlight during the day. However, the middle of a small south-facing room falls into zone 1, and the middle of a north-facing room is too dark for most crops.

   Suitable plants:

   * Shade-tolerant herbs (e.g., mint, parsley)
   * Edible spring flowers
   * Edible orchids
   * Sprouts, leaves, & some roots
   * Alpine strawberries

## Cool zones

Some plants that are normally pollinated by insects are easier to grow on an outside windowsill where bees can still reach them. Other crops that hail from Mediterranean climes or areas with a cool winter need lower temperatures at this time of year to produce their fruits the following summer.

1. **Cool (unheated) south-facing room:** Grow plants such as strawberries, some herbs, and leafy and root vegetables in this zone all year round. Most fruit trees, including figs, citrus, peaches, and nectarines, need lower temperatures in winter to produce fruits the next year.

   Suitable plants:

   * Herbs
   * Leafy crops
   * Root vegetables
   * Fruits (over winter)
2. **Outside Windowsill or Balcony:** Some outdoor space, such as a windowsill or [balcony](https://urbangardener.wiki/posts/balcony-gardening-ideas-w-plant--planter-tips/) is useful for a gardener since plants normally pollinated by insects tend to be more productive here. The increase in air circulation also guards against some plant fungal diseases. Tender crops, such as tomatoes, peppers, and cucamelons, should not be put outside until all risk of frost has passed in late spring.

   Suitable plants:

   * Herbs & edible flowers (most)
   * Leafy crops
   * Bush tomatoes
   * Chiles
   * Sweet peppers
   * Cucamelons
   * Strawberries
