## Benefits and advantages of indoor gardening

### Access to fresh produce

Growing your fruits, vegetables, and herbs indoors provides you with fresh produce year-round, regardless of the season. You can use grow lights, heaters, irrigation, and humidifiers to create the right environment for your plants. Especially, [growing herbs indoors](https://urbangardener.wiki/posts/how-to-grow-herbs-indoors/) is convenient and perfect for use in the kitchen.

### Control over weather

Indoor gardening gives you full control over the weather conditions, and you don't have to worry about the possibility of violent winds, cold snaps, or overly hot weather killing your plants. Growing your plants indoors allows you to customize the environment for your plants, from light and temperature to humidity.

### Fewer pests

Establishing your garden inside your home reduces the risk of infestation from pests. While you may still see a few pests, the likelihood of an infestation is much lower than when growing plants outdoors. You can monitor indoor plants more easily and stop any infestations before they become problematic.

### Protection from outdoor animals

Indoor gardening protects your plants from outdoor animals, including mice, rabbits, cats, deer, and other wildlife that may feast on your plants.

### Extended growing season

Growing plants indoors provides you with an extended growing season. You can start your seedlings and bulbs weeks before the final frost in your region, giving them a head start on the season.

### Air purification

Indoor plants can act as natural air purifiers, filtering dust, germs, and airborne toxins. They produce oxygen and remove carbon dioxide from the air, which is opposite of how humans breathe. Spider plants, snake plants, English ivy, and chrysanthemums are some examples of indoor plants that can help purify the air.

### Aesthetic appeal

Indoor gardening can enhance the aesthetic appeal of your living space. Plants can brighten up any room and add vibrancy to your home. You can create a delightful display of your garden or use a single plant to bring life to a space.

### Control Noise Exposure

With an indoor garden, you have complete control over noise exposure. Unlike outdoor gardens that expose you to loud noises from honking cars, barking dogs, and lawnmowers, indoor gardening provides a noise-controlled environment. This can be beneficial for individuals with tinnitus or hearing aids.

### Easy to Start

Indoor gardens are easier to start than outdoor ones. All you need are plants, sufficient sunlight or artificial light, and containers. You can even recycle containers you have at home, like butter jars or coffee cans. Herbs are an excellent choice for beginner gardeners and require at least six hours of sunlight each day.

### Family-Friendly

Gardening is an excellent opportunity to teach your kids about responsibility and sustainable living. There are various gardening kits designed for kids, making the process engaging for your little ones.

### Therapeutic

Plants provide emotional therapy and make great company. Tending to an indoor garden is all about caring for another living thing's needs, fostering a sense of compassion. Gardening tasks such as watering, pruning, and repotting are therapeutic and can reduce symptoms of stress and depression.

### Health Benefits

Medical experts recommend gardening to improve wellbeing and mental health. It's also a way of getting exercise, helping you stay fit. An indoor garden can reduce psychological and physiological stress and create a calming and comfortable environment.
