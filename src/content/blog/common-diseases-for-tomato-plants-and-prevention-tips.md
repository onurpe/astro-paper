## Tomato plants are susceptible to a variety of diseases, which can affect the health and productivity of the plant. Some common diseases of tomato plants include:

* **Early blight:** Early blight is a fungal disease that causes dark, circular lesions on the leaves and stems of the plant. It can also affect the fruit, causing it to rot. To prevent early blight, avoid overhead watering and remove any infected plants or plant debris from the garden. If the plant is severely infected, it may need to be destroyed.
* **Late blight:** Late blight is another fungal disease that causes dark, water-soaked lesions on the leaves, stems, and fruit of the plant. It can also cause the plant to wilt and die. To prevent late blight, avoid overhead watering and remove any infected plants or plant debris from the garden. If the plant is severely infected, it may need to be destroyed.
* **Fusarium wilt:** Fusarium wilt is a fungal disease that causes the leaves of the plant to turn yellow and wilt. It can also affect the stem, causing it to turn brown and wilt. To prevent Fusarium wilt, choose resistant varieties of tomato plants and avoid planting tomatoes in the same location year after year. If the plant is severely infected, it may need to be destroyed.
* **Verticillium wilt:** Verticillium wilt is a fungal disease that causes the leaves of the plant to turn yellow and wilt. It can also affect the stem, causing it to turn brown and wilt. To prevent Verticillium wilt, choose resistant varieties of tomato plants and avoid planting tomatoes in the same location year after year. If the plant is severely infected, it may need to be destroyed.
* **Bacterial wilt:** Bacterial wilt is a bacterial disease that causes the leaves of the plant to wilt and die. It can also cause the stem to become slimy and rot. To prevent bacterial wilt, choose resistant varieties of tomato plants and avoid planting tomatoes in the same location year after year. If the plant is severely infected, it may need to be destroyed.

To identify these diseases, look for the specific symptoms described above and consult with a local extension office or plant pathologist for confirmation. To solve these diseases, it is important to take preventative measures, such as choosing resistant varieties and rotating crops, and to destroy any infected plants to prevent the disease from spreading. If the plant is severely infected, it may need to be destroyed.
