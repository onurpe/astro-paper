Tomatoes are vulnerable to a wide range of pests and diseases, making it crucial to identify the cause of any issues with the plants. Whiteflies and hornworms are the most common pests found in tomato crops, along with flea beetles and aphids. Additionally, tomato plants are prone to blossom-end rot, which poses a high risk to their development.

## Tomato Plants Diseases and Pests (With Pictures)

Here are common tomato plant diseases with pictures and tips for prevention and treatment for your tomato plants: 

1. **Late Blight:** 

   ![Late blight can cause grey mold on fruits and stems, which then turns brown](/images/uploads/late-blight-tomato.jpeg "Late blight can cause grey mold on fruits and stems, which then turns brown")

   This fungal disease can cause grey mold on fruits and stems, which then turns brown. It overwinters in soil and can infect the next crop. *To prevent, avoid planting tomatoes in the same area for two consecutive years. Apply fungicides like copper-based products early in the season as a preventative measure. In case of infection, remove the affected plants and dispose of them away from the garden.*
2. **Mosaic Virus:**

   ![Mosaic virus causes stunted early development of stems, twisting and distortion, and mottled yellow foliage.](/images/uploads/mosaic-virus-tomato.jpeg "Mosaic virus causes stunted early development of stems, twisting and distortion, and mottled yellow foliage.")

   This disease causes stunted early development of stems, twisting and distortion, and mottled yellow foliage. *Infected plants should be removed and thrown away in the trash. To prevent, purchase disease-resistant varieties of tomato plants and keep them isolated from other susceptible plants. Also, avoid smoking near plants, as tobacco smoke can spread the virus.*
3. **Whitefly:**

   ![This sucking insect causes chlorotic spots, leaf wilting, and the spread of disease to foliage.](/images/uploads/whitefly-tomato.jpeg "This sucking insect causes chlorotic spots, leaf wilting, and the spread of disease to foliage.")

   This sucking insect causes chlorotic spots, leaf wilting, and the spread of disease to foliage. *Infestations should be treated immediately to prevent plant weakening. To prevent, use sticky traps and reflective mulch to deter them. Neem oil and insecticidal soap can also help control the population.*
4. **Hornworms:** 

   ![Hornworms can grow over 3 inches long and cause damage to foliage and unripe fruits](/images/uploads/hornworms-tomato.jpeg "Hornworms can grow over 3 inches long and cause damage to foliage and unripe fruits")

   These caterpillars can grow over 3 inches long and cause damage to foliage and unripe fruits. They appear near mid-summer after moths lay eggs on the underside of leaves. *Physical removal by hand is the easiest control method. Use a biological control like Bacillus thuringiensis (BT) or spinosad, which are toxic to the caterpillar but safe for humans and other beneficial insects.*
5. **Fruit-worm Larva:**

   ![Fruit-worm larva cause extensive damage and rot by entering green fruits like tomato](/images/uploads/tomato-fruitworm-larva.jpeg "Fruit-worm larva cause extensive damage and rot by entering green fruits like tomato")

   These pests cause extensive damage and rot by entering green fruits near the stem and boring through from the inside out until pupation. *To prevent, apply neem oil or insecticidal soap early in the season to prevent egg laying. Remove affected fruits as soon as they are noticed to prevent further damage.*
6. **Aphids:** 

   ![Tomato aphids are sucking insects](/images/uploads/tomato-aphids.jpeg "Tomato aphids are sucking insects")

   These tiny sucking insects weaken plants, damage foliage and stems, and cause sooty mold. *To prevent, plant resistant tomato varieties and companion plants like marigolds and basil. Wiping aphids off with a damp cloth and dusting the plant with diatomaceous earth are effective countermeasures. Alternatively, use Sevin and Neem oil.*
7. **Stink Bugs:** 

   ![Stink Bugs are half-inch beetle-looking insects feed on ripening tomato fruits](/images/uploads/stink-bug.jpeg "Stink Bugs are half-inch beetle-looking insects feed on ripening tomato fruits")

   These half-inch beetle-looking insects feed on ripening tomato fruits and leave behind a yellowing, necrotic-looking spot. Weedy areas are a huge draw for stink bugs, so keeping weeds down around the garden can help deter them. *Applying kaolin powder to a sprayer and spraying the plants provides a protective barrier against stink bugs. Insecticides can also be used as a last resort.*
8. **Spider Mites:** 

   ![Spider mites are practically impossible to notice until you have a full-blown infestation](/images/uploads/tomato-spider-mites.jpeg "Spider mites are practically impossible to notice until you have a full-blown infestation")

   These tiny pests are practically impossible to notice until you have a full-blown infestation and serious damage to your crops. They live on the underside of leaves and won't just feed on your tomatoes either. *To prevent, regularly spray plants with water to discourage dust buildup. If an infestation occurs, use a strong blast of water to knock them off the plant. Apply neem oil or insecticidal soap as a control measure.*

## Tips for Preventing Tomato Diseases

Tomato diseases can be numerous and difficult to manage. However, taking preventive measures can help keep your tomato plants healthy and disease-free. It all starts with proper planting techniques, such as crop rotation every 1 to 3 years to discourage soil-borne pathogens and providing enough space and support for your plants to allow for proper air circulation.

To avoid making your plants a target for diseases, follow these rules:

* **Minimize irrigation:** Water only when the top three inches of soil are dry to avoid creating a humid environment that can promote disease growth.
* **Water at ground level:** Avoid wetting leaves to prevent the spread of diseases.
* **Water in the morning:** This allows the soil to dry and keeps humidity low.
* **Remove sickly or withered leaves:** These can spread possible diseases/bugs, so remove them as soon as possible.
* **Prune out dense foliage and suckers:** This allows for better air flow around the plants.
* **Keep nearby vegetation down:** This allows for better air flow and lower humidity.
* **Disinfect tomato tools from one season/area to the next:** This helps prevent the spread of disease.
* **Control insect pests:** Pests can spread diseases, so make sure to control them.
* **Fertilize:** Fertilizing can help keep plants healthy and strong to stave off infection.

By following these rules, you can greatly reduce the risk of your tomato plants being affected by diseases. If you do notice any signs of disease, it's important to act quickly to prevent it from spreading. There are a variety of treatments available, including fungicides and insecticides, but it's best to consult with a gardening professional for advice on the most effective treatment for your specific situation.
