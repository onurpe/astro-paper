1. Tomatoes can be picked at any stage of growth, either green or ripe, for consumption or ripening off the vine.
2. Depending on the variety of your plant, ripened tomatoes may be yellow, purple, red, or a mix of colors.

3. To avoid splitting or bruising, pick your tomatoes early and allow them to ripen on your countertop or let them ripen naturally on the vine and pick them when they're ready to enjoy.
4. Leave your tomatoes on the plant for as long as possible, but if you notice cracking, you may be watering too much or adding too much fertilizer.

5. Avoid leaving tomatoes on the windowsill to ripen, as they may rot before turning ripe.
6. If any tomatoes fall off the plant before they're ripe, put them in a brown paper bag and store them in your root cellar.
7. Don't irrigate your tomatoes too much, as it can remove some of the flavors.
8. Tomatoes don't freeze well, and their skins may slip off after defrosting.
9. For the best taste, leave them on the vine as long as possible. They change color and ripen best when daytime temperatures stay around 75°F (24°C).
10. If temperatures drop, bring all mature fruits (green or not) indoors. Green tomatoes can be ripened indoors by storing them in a cool, dark space or even a brown paper bag.
11. Another method of ripening green tomatoes is to pull the entire plant from the garden and hang it upside down in a dark area, like your basement. As the fruit ripens, you can pick it and use it as desired.
