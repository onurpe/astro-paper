## Troubleshooting Your Herbs: Common Issues and Solutions

Are your herbs not growing as fast as you'd like, or are they suffering from brown patches, withered leaves, whitish fuzz on the soil, soft stems, or bug infestations? Don't worry, these are common problems and can be easily solved!

* Slow Growth or Limited Germination

Insufficient light may be the issue. Herbs require at least five hours of light daily to thrive, and full sunshine is best if the area isn't too hot. However, in winter, even a south-facing window might not provide enough light. If you notice slow growth, try increasing the hours of light up to fourteen if necessary.

* Brown Patches or Withered-Looking Leaves

If your herbs are located under a light source, they may be too close to the bulb and are getting burned. Herbs should be placed at least 6 to 8 inches away from the light source, and the distance should be measured from the bulb to the top of the plant.

* Whitish Fuzz on Soil

The whitish fuzz on the soil could be due to natural seed germination, but it may also be mold. Check if you're overwatering your plants by feeling the soil mix. If you feel moisture immediately upon inserting your finger into the soil, then overwatering may be the issue. Let the plant "dry out" and isolate it from other plants in the meantime. Remove the moldy areas, but be aware that you may need to start over with this plant.

* Stems Seem Soft or Mushy

Another possibility of soft stems is overwatering, which can lead to root rot. A foul smell mixed with the pleasant herb scent is a clear indication of problems.

* Bug Infestation in Progress

It's disappointing to discover that your herbs are being eaten by bugs. If this happens, isolate the plant and try a soap spray made with mild liquid soap (like Dr. Bronner's) and water. Spray in the evening when the plant isn't in full sunlight, as applying the spray when the plant is exposed to sunlight can cause it to dry out.
