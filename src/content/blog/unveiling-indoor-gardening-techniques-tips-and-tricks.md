Indoor gardening offers more flexibility than traditional outdoor gardening methods. It is easy to use and can increase your chances of success the first time you try it. Here are some popular indoor gardening techniques that you can try:

## Container Gardening

Starting an indoor garden with container gardening is the simplest and most affordable method. You can repurpose many containers you have lying around your house such as milk jugs, plastic soda bottles, baskets with a plastic liner, and mason jars. Alternatively, commercially available options such as window sill planter boxes and ceramic containers are also great choices. However, if you want to create your container, use rot-resistant wood like redwood or cedar to avoid using treated wood that can potentially harm your crop and soil.

## Herb Gardening

Growing herbs indoors is an excellent way to introduce yourself to container gardening. Herbs are hardy, require very little space, and are versatile. You can use them as natural supplements, culinary tools, and even as insect repellents. Place your herb garden in an area with at least five hours of sunlight per day, such as on a windowsill.

## Vertical Gardening

You can grow a year's worth of food in a limited space with vertical gardening. Vertical gardening systems are perfect for some crops and takes up minimal space.  describes the design you can use to create your own vertical garden.

## Hydroponics

This method often yields a higher-quality crop, but purchasing the equipment can be costly.
