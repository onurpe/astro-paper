Indoor gardening offers more flexibility than traditional outdoor gardening methods. It is easy to use and can increase your chances of success the first time you try it. Here are some popular indoor gardening techniques that you can try:
*Container Gardening
Container gardening is the most straightforward way to begin gardening
indoors. It is affordable, and you can use almost any container available
at home. Milk jugs, plastic soda bottles, mason jars, and baskets with a
plastic liner can all be repurposed as containers. There are also many
commercially available options, such as window sill planter boxes and
ceramic containers. If you want to create your own container, it is best to
use rot-resistant wood such as redwood or cedar. They are a healthier
alternative to treated wood that can leak chemicals into your soil and crop.*
Herb Gardening
Growing herbs indoors is an excellent variation of container gardening. Herbs
are hardy, take up little space, and are versatile. They can be used as culinary
tools, natural supplements, and even insect repellent. Herbs thrive in areas
with at least five hours of sunlight per day, such as windowsills.
*Vertical Gardening Hacks
Vertical gardening can help you grow a year's worth of food in a limited space.
In this book, you will learn how to build a vertical gardening system. While
it may not be ideal for growing all crops, it is perfect for some and takes up
minimal space. Chapter Seven describes the design you can use to create
your own vertical garden.*
Hydroponics
Hydroponics is a popular indoor gardening technique that involves replacing
soil with a nutrient-rich water solution. Plants grown using hydroponics often
yield a higher-quality crop. However, purchasing the equipment to set up a
hydroponic garden can be costly. In Chapter Seven, you will learn how to
build an affordable hydroponic system using materials from your local
hardware store.
Using a combination of these techniques is the best way to consistently
grow high-quality crops in any indoor space.
